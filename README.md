# ru_psw_mng
A password manager app written in Rust

Update 13.11.2023
Got the manager to a semi-working state. You can now create the tables, save a user and save his passwords. You still can't get the passwords out.

Update 15.11.2023
Implemented a get function that returns the saved password for a user on a website. Next, I will try to make the experience more user-friendly.

Update 16.11.2023
Implemented a function to change the user's main password. Next, I'll write a function to change the saved password for a certain website. Also, my manager needs an option to clear all of passwords of a user.

Update 18.11.2023
Implemented a function to delete a user from the database.
